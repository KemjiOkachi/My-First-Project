Enter rock paper or scissors
if you won it'll tell you so and also tell you what it played in order for you to win
if you lost it'll do the same
if you typed a variable not among the choices the output will be "invalid, please try again"
each time you play it counts your attempts, your wins and your losses
you may quit at any time by typing "quit"
